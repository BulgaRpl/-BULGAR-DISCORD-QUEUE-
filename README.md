### Install

All you need to do is upload the script to the server then configure the config, the original configuration/instruction can be found [here](https://docs.badger.store/fivem-discord-scripts/bad-discordqueue), it is not much changed just there may be missing some options or there are more of them.

```
ensure bulgar_Discord_Queue
```
### Features

- The script is modified for RedM but it Should also work for FiveM.
- Grace Priority (Back Ticket) -> The player, after leaving the server, has X minutes to return to the queue with the highest possible priority.
- Discord Whitelist -> The player must have the appropriate rank on discord to join, this also applies to priority settings.
- Steam Join Requirement -> In this version, steam is required for the queue to work.
- Anti-Spam before Join the Queue.

### Other

Many things have been deleted, fixed, changed compared to the original script. The script is still (WiP) I hope that together we will finally create a cool and, above all, free queue for RedM and FiveM.
